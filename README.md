## NBA 2023 Scoring Leaders Infographic Project 
![NBA 2022-23 Scoring Leaders](https://github.com/Mon224/Mon224.GitHub.io/blob/main/NBA%20Scoring%20Leaders%202022-23%20(1).png?raw=true) 

This project was for our infographic, for this visualization I decided to show the top 5 scoring leaders in the 2022-23 NBA season. This season Joel Embiid led the league in scoring and won the MVP of the league which was monumental because he is the first african player since Hakeem Olajuwon. Moreover, the other four players were really good and some of them such as Shai Gilgeous Alexander had a breakout season, while people like Giannis, Dame, and Luka remained consistent. This infographic is important because it allows the readers and general fans of the NBA or even the casual to understand who the most dominant players in the league are.

## Kobe Bryant
Description 
Kobe Bryant was the 13th pick in the 1996 draft and he put together one of the most extraordinary careers in the history of the NBA. Kobe's sheer will and love for the game allowed him to squeeze every bit of talent in him in order to win. Kobe's mamba mentality is why he resonated with so many people as he inspired many people never to give up no matter what. Unfortunately, in 2020 Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash in what is considered one of the saddest days ever for the sports world however this is the reason why I chose him for my timeline project to celebrate his amazing career and life.

## Bar Chart 
Description 
Within this bar chart, I decided to look into the diversity of Lehigh University by looking at the undergraduate enrollment by ethnicity. In the bar chart, we noticed that Lehigh is still a predominantly white institution as 60 percent of the students are white however 20 percent of the students on campus are either Hispanic or Asian. I decided to use this data for my bar chart because it is important to see the diversity which raises questions on how the school can improve and sheds light on the underrepresentation of minorities on campus.

## Line Chart HW 
Description 
In the National Basketball Association, there are players who have been scouted since they were kids and were destined to have hall-of-fame careers. A player like Lebron James was instantly given the keys in Cleveland and was expected to carry the team on his back straight out of high school which he did and went on to have the greatest career ever. However, players like Harden and Curry were not labeled the chosen one instantly as Harden came off the bench and was considered the third fiddle in Oklahoma until he ended up leaving that team and making a name for himself in Houston. Meanwhile, a player like Curry who went to a small school like Davidosn and had to grind his way into becoming a household name did not see instant success in the NBA however once it clicked he became arguably one of the greatest ever. Ultimately these three players are undeniably some of the greatest players of this generation and today we will track their scoring since they've all been in the league.
