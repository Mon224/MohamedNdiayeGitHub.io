## NBA 2023 Scoring Leaders Infographic Project 
![NBA 2022-23 Scoring Leaders](https://github.com/Mon224/Mon224.GitHub.io/blob/main/NBA%20Scoring%20Leaders%202022-23%20(1).png?raw=true) 

This project was for our infographic, for this visualization I decided to show the top 5 scoring leaders in the 2022-23 NBA season. This season Joel Embiid led the league in scoring and won the MVP of the league which was monumental because he is the first african player since Hakeem Olajuwon. Moreover, the other four players were really good and some of them such as Shai Gilgeous Alexander had a breakout season, while people like Giannis, Dame, and Luka remained consistent. This infographic is important because it allows the readers and general fans of the NBA or even the casual to understand who the most dominant players in the league are.
