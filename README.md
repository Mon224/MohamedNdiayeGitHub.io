## NBA 2023 Scoring Leaders Infographic Project 
![NBA 2022-23 Scoring Leaders](https://github.com/Mon224/Mon224.GitHub.io/blob/main/NBA%20Scoring%20Leaders%202022-23%20(1).png?raw=true) 

This project was for our infographic, for this visualization I decided to show the top 5 scoring leaders in the 2022-23 NBA season. This season Joel Embiid led the league in scoring and won the MVP of the league which was monumental because he is the first african player since Hakeem Olajuwon. Moreover, the other four players were really good and some of them such as Shai Gilgeous Alexander had a breakout season, while people like Giannis, Dame, and Luka remained consistent. This infographic is important because it allows the readers and general fans of the NBA or even the casual to understand who the most dominant players in the league are.

## Kobe Bryant
Description 
Kobe Bryant was the 13th pick in the 1996 draft and he put together one of the most extraordinary careers in the history of the NBA. Kobe's sheer will and love for the game allowed him to squeeze every bit of talent in him in order to win. Kobe's mamba mentality is why he resonated with so many people as he inspired many people never to give up no matter what. Unfortunately, in 2020 Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash in what is considered one of the saddest days ever for the sports world however this is the reason why I chose him for my timeline project to celebrate his amazing career and life.

## Bar Chart 
Description 
Within this bar chart, I decided to look into the diversity of Lehigh University by looking at the undergraduate enrollment by ethnicity. In the bar chart, we noticed that Lehigh is still a predominantly white institution as 60 percent of the students are white however 20 percent of the students on campus are either Hispanic or Asian. I decided to use this data for my bar chart because it is important to see the diversity which raises questions on how the school can improve and sheds light on the underrepresentation of minorities on campus.
